  <p>
   Fixing electronics around the house has been a childhood hobby. I happened to develop this into something bigger, during my engineering years, where I had plenty of spare time.
   I have helped solder up electronics projects for my friends. However, what I love mainly is building things that can move.<br><br>
   I have built few planes and drones. I am presently working on improving my FPV drone, which I built a few years ago.
   Wanderlust is also something that I believe I have abundance of, which has lead me to exploring a lot of places in and around my hometown.
   While cycling helped me discover places, my love for biking and road trips has taken me to several trekking spots and nature camps.
   I enjoy long bike rides with my friends too, they makes any journey complete.
